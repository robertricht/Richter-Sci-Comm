			<h2>Science & Technology Escape Games</h2>

		<p>
			I build live escape challenges that translate real scientific concepts into tangible puzzles and collaborative
			stories. Instead of “random locks”, the mechanisms, clues, and interactions are grounded in physics, technology,
			and making—designed to be playful, surprising, and understandable while still feeling like a real escape game.
			Formats range from portable pop-up games to full rooms and festival-ready experiences.

					<h3>Quantum Escape Room</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					A puzzle-driven introduction to quantum concepts—built around hands-on interactions, physical props,
					and narrative progression. Players explore ideas like measurement, uncertainty, and “strange” correlations
					through mechanisms they can operate themselves.
